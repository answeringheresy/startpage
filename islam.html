                        introduction: "Islam and the 'prophet' Muhammad in particular can be described in one word: clueless. Muhammad, over the course of his 23 year 'prophethood', had absolutely no clue what he was doing or saying. The character Muhammad is a good representation of what people in  7th century arabia believed, mixed with a pinch of interest and admiration for abrahamic belief. This exactly describes Muhammad. Perhaps we shouldn't blame him for his character and his words, but rather for his lying about being a prophet, because his personal beliefs (such as mysogny, having no issues with cruelty, child marriage, etc.) were simply a reflection of what people in the 7th century thought to be true. It is also possible that he suffered from a mental illness or truly was possessed by demons. What is clear to say though: Muhammad was neither an example for all times, nor is Islam a religion for all times. And yet Islam is becoming more and more popular especially among teenage boys and girls, due to the fact that it seems so 'simple' and 'logical' and perhaps even trustworthy, especially because popular Muslim apologists constantly, and i mean constantly, lie about Islam. The things people do not want to hear, they won't tell you. That's why the truth is that it is the complete opposite. Islam copied so much from Judaism, Christianity and other Pagan beliefs that its core theology from the plain text is extremely inconsistent and confused, the Quran, when you truly investigate it, is an incredibly sloppy and unimpressive book. It's not simple either: because of this, plenty of Islamic theology is messed up and simply makes no sense. It's inconsistent. This is exactly what happens when you copy from Jews and Christians without understanding what it means. The morality of Muhammad and the Quran are explained away and defended with tons of lies and deceiving comparisons. What Muslims for example very much like to do when confronted with a moral issue is to deflect it back to the Bible and be something like 'Your bible is even worse!', and that critique is extemely inaccurate or taken out of context entirely. It's very unfortunate so many are falling for these lies without investigating it themselves. A phrase repeated over and over on the internet is this, and you might know it 'without lies, Islam dies'. It is sadly very fitting.",

Nonetheless, despite many modern muslims today denying the fact that you can have multiple women, Muhammad himself told the convert to select four of his eight wives, and divorce the rest. If polygamy was only allowed to care for women in need, why does Muhammad tell the man to divorce four, and keep four? If the women were in need, four of them would have lost their basis of living. if the women weren't in need, it means Islam endorses polygamy, which is the more probable explanation."

It's talking about prepubescent girls and it gives them a waiting period between marriages, and that waiting period only applies when the woman (or girl) had sex with her partner.

Because Muslims believe the Quran is the actual, uncreated, eternal, timeless speech of Allah, meaning that if there is just ONE mistake or inaccuracy, it would mean that Islam as a religion is false. Christians do not hold this belief. This is also why Muslims keep telling unbelievers to 'point out one mistake in the Quran', and when such a mistake is brought, they go on tangents, claim that the Arabic needs to be interpreted differently, twist the passage, or bring an explanation so far fetched that in all of human history 99% of humans wouldn't have been able to conclude this from the plain text. Muslims already presuppose that the Quran is true, hence, when the Quran contains a clear error, it crushes their worldview and they must apply horrendous mental gymnastics to make sense out of this blunder. So, in principal, it goes like this:",        sources: [

As for the resemblance of the child to its parents: <strong>If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.</strong>",

Muhammad was afraid and it was his wife who convinced him it was actually an angel speaking to him. Over the course of 23 years, whenever Muhammad was 'divinely inspired', he sweated, felt heavy, and showed signs of demonic possesion. Muhammad also wanted to throw himself off a cliff multiple times and at some point believed he had done things he never actually did. Was Muhammad a victim of Satan or did he suffer from a mental illness?",

Mu`adh said to Abu Musa, 'O `Abdullah bin Qais! What is this?' Abu Musa replied. 'This man has reverted to Heathenism after embracing Islam.' Mu`adh said, 'I will not dismount till he is killed.' Abu Musa replied, 'He has been brought for this purpose, so come down.' Mu`adh said, 'I will not dismount till he is killed.' So Abu Musa ordered that he be killed, and he was killed. Then Mu`adh dismounted and said, 'O `Abdullah (bin Qais)! How do you recite the Qur'an ?' Abu Musa said, 'I recite the Qur'an regularly at intervals and piecemeal. How do you recite it O Mu`adh?' Mu`adh said, 'I sleep in the first part of the night and then get up after having slept for the time devoted for my sleep and then recite as much as Allah has written for me. So I seek Allah's Reward for both my sleep as well as my prayer (at night).",

As discussed in this video, however, the earliest sources all depict al-Zutt as humans, meaning the night in question had nothing to do with the Jinn, and therefore the testimony of Abdullah — a chief and trusted transmitter of hadith — remains valid (the one argument raised against this hadith, that Abdullah was not present during the Night of the Jinn, becomes a moot point).<br>https://www.raymondibrahim.com/05/13/2025/video-who-rode-muhammad-all-night-long-and-why"

So God relieved them and cancelled the verse with another saying: 'Now has God relieved you and He knows that there is weakness amongst you, so if there are a hundred steadfast they shall overcome two hundred, and if there are a thousand of you they shall overcome two thousand by God's permission, for God is with the steadfast.'",

When he turned his face to us he said, 'If there had been anything changed in the prayer, surely I would have informed you but I am a human being like you and liable to forget like you. So if I forget remind me and if anyone of you is doubtful about his prayer, he should follow what he thinks to be correct and complete his prayer accordingly and finish it and do two prostrations (of Sahu).",

Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur'an be collected.' I said to `Umar, 'How can you do something which Allah's Apostle did not do?' `Umar said, 'By Allah, that is a good project.' `Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which `Umar had realized.' Then Abu Bakr said (to me). 'You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). So you should search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur'an and collect it in one book.' By Allah If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur'an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, 'How will you do something which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not do?' Abu Bakr replied, 'By Allah, it is a good project.' Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and `Umar. So I started looking for the Qur'an and collecting it from (what was written on) palme stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat at-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The Verse is: 'Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa' (at-Tauba) (9.128-129). Then the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur'an remained with Abu Bakr till he died, then with `Umar till the end of his life, and then with Hafsa, the daughter of `Umar.",

So `Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, 'Send us the manuscripts of the Qur'an so that we may compile the Qur'anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you.' Hafsa sent it to `Uthman. `Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin AzZubair, Sa`id bin Al-As and `AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. `Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, 'In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur'an, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur'an was revealed in their tongue.' They did so, and when they had written many copies, `Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. `Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur'anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt.",

Initially, however, the publication of this edition was a purely Egyptian affair. It was the work of a government appointed committee, led by Muhammad b. ‘Ali al-Husayni al-Haddad, that was meant to establish a uniform text for religious education in Egypt. Minor adjustments were subsequently made to this text in following editions, one published later in 1924 and another in 1936. [...] The Egyptian government was motivated to begin the project that would lead to the Cairo Qur’an edition due to the variations (or “errors,” as an appendix to the Cairo edition describes them) found in the Qur’anic texts that they had been importing for state schools. In response, the government destroyed a large number of such texts by sinking them in the Nile River and issued its own text. The Cairo project thus followed in the spirit of the caliph ‘Uthman, and the governor al-Hajjaj b. Yusuf (d. 95/714), who are reported to have destroyed competing versions and distributed their own text of the Qur’an in the first Islamic century.",

'Should not your ears listen to what your mouth is saying,'</strong> he retorted. Thereupon he seized him and delivered him to Nimrod. 'Let us worship the fire!' he [Nimrod] proposed. 'Let us rather worship water, which extinguishes the fire,' replied he. 'Then let us worship water!' 'Let us rather worship the clouds which bear the water.' 'Then let us worship the clouds!' 'Let us rather worship the winds which disperse the clouds.' 'Then let us worship the wind!' 'Let us rather worship human beings, who withstand the wind.' <strong>'You are just bandying words,' he exclaimed; 'we will worship nought but the fire. Behold, I will cast you into it, and let your God whom you adore come and save you from it.'</strong> Now Haran was standing there undecided. If Abram is victorious, [thought he], I will say that I am of Abram's belief, while if Nimrod is victorious I will say that I am on Nimrod's side. <strong>When Abram descended into the fiery furnace and was saved,</strong> he [Nimrod] asked him, 'Of whose belief are you?'

Or why doth thy malice assail us? Have we taken away thy glory and caused thee to be without honour? Why dost thou harry us, thou enemy (and persecute us) to the death in wickedness and envy?' And with a heavy sigh, the devil spake: 'O Adam! all my hostility, envy, and sorrow is for thee, <strong>since it is for thee that I have been expelled from my glory, which I possessed in the heavens in the midst of the angels and for thee was I cast out in the earth.</strong>' Adam answered, 'What dost thou tell me? What have I done to thee or what is my fault against thee? Seeing that thou hast received no harm or injury from us, why dost thou pursue us?' <strong>The devil replied, 'Adam, what dost thou tell me? It is for thy sake that I have been hurled from that place. When thou wast formed. I was hurled out of the presence of God and banished from the company of the angels. When God blew into thee the breath of life and thy face and likeness was made in the image of God, Michael also brought thee and made (us) worship thee in the sight of God; and God the Lord spake: Here is Adam. I have made thee in our image and likeness.' And Michael went out and called all the angels saying: 'Worship the image of God as the Lord God hath commanded.' And Michael himself worshipped first; then he called me and said: 'Worship the image of God the Lord.' And I answered, 'I have no (need) to worship Adam.' And since Michael kept urging me to worship, I said to him, 'Why dost thou urge me? I will not worship an inferior and younger being (than I). I am his senior in the Creation, before he was made was I already made. It is his duty to worship me.' When the angels, who were under me, heard this, they refused to worship him. And Michael saith, 'Worship the image of God, but if thou wilt not worship him, the Lord God will be wrath with thee.' And I said, 'If He be wrath with me, I will set my seat above the stars of heaven and will be like the Highest.' And God the Lord was wrath with me and banished me and my angels from our glory; and on thy account were we expelled from our abodes into this world and hurled on the earth. And straightway we were overcome with grief, since we had been spoiled of so great glory.</strong>",

Then the child Jesus, with a joyful countenance, reposing in the bosom of His mother, said to the palm: O tree, bend thy branches, and refresh my mother with thy fruit. And immediately at these words the palm bent its top down to the very feet of the blessed Mary; and they gathered from it fruit, with which they were all refreshed. And after they had gathered all its fruit, it remained bent down, waiting the order to rise from Him who had commanded it to stoop. Then Jesus said to it: Raise thyself, O palm tree, and be strong, and be the companion of my trees, which are in the paradise of my Father; and open from thy roots a vein of water which has been hid in the earth, and let the waters flow, so that we may be satisfied from thee. And it rose up immediately, and at its root there began to come forth a spring of water exceedingly clear and cool and sparkling. And when they saw the spring of water, they rejoiced with great joy, and were satisfied, themselves and all their cattle and their beasts. Wherefore they gave thanks to God.",

This means, at the time of Muhammad, he had the same Bible we have today, and he confirmed it. So Muhammad confirmed the same Bible we have in our possession today. But we know this Bible completely contradicts the Quran on various topics: the divinity of Christ, the crucifixion, the resurrection, God being our father, the creation story, etc. Muslims have been aware of this for a long time and invented the claim that the Bible therefore must be corrupted or changed, because the Quran affirms its inspiration, but contradicts it in the same chapter. So, Muslims started believing in two sets of 'original scripture' that were truly revealed by Allah and then later changed. But does the Quran say anything remotely close to that? No. Here are a few passages Muslims like to quote in support of a corrupted Bible:"

One thing you shouldn't forget is that Muhammad was illiterate. He didn't know how to write or read. Considering most of the Quran was copied from Jews and Christians at the time of Muhammad (for that also view 'Islam the Copycat'), you would naturally expect that he has no clue what is written inside the Bible. Now, there are verses where the Quran explicitly goes against christian teaching (such as the Trinity or Jesus being God), so Muhammad was certainly aware of what Christians believed. My personal theory is this: Muhammad knew the Christians believed in the Trinity and that Jesus is divine (because people told him sometime, he heard it somewhere) but he thought those beliefs are actually nowhere to be found in the Bible (he most likely also heard that from somewhere / someone). That would explain him confirming the Bible but contradicting it at the same time, and it would also explain why he keeps putting an emphasis on the 'People of the Book' corrupting the Torah and the Bible with their tongues."

Another person was given the resemblence of Jesus to die in his place<br>2. They believed they killed Jesus but it wasn't actually Him<br><br>There are some other theories of what Allah means when he says 'it appeared so'.<br>Lets investigate these two theories: <br><br>1. Someone was given the resemblence of Jesus: for some reason, when Jesus was about to be crucified, someone else was given the resemblence of Jesus to be crucified. But why was Jesus condemned to crucifixion in the first place? Historically we know why, because he claimed to be God. But Islam rejects this. According to Islam, Jesus went around saying 'Believe in one God!' and for that, they wanted to kill Him. Why did they want to crucifiy Him in the first place? And why exactly would Allah do this? Why did Allah not simply save Jesus from the crucifixion but instead make it to appear so that he is being crucified? For what reason? Given the fact Muslims believe that Allah is outside of time, he would know this event would ultimately start the rise of christianity. So why did he do it? Allah created christianity, a false religion that would lead billions into hellfire, the biggest contender to Islam, tons of wars and battles fought over this division, tons of deaths, tons of confusion, tons of people going to hell. At the end of the day it was his fault that the people living at Jesus' time believed he was being crucified. So, Allah purposely deceived billions of people into believing something that never actually truly happened. Christians would get punished because Allah played a trick on them. Does that sound fair?<br><br>2. They mistakened Jesus and killed somebody else: this is highly unlikely as the Romans knew how to kill people. A blunder like this by the Romans in the first century is highly unlikely. But let's say it did happen: how does that explain the rise of christianity? Why did christianity start in the first place? Wouldn't the disciples notice that the person being crucified is not Jesus? No answers. Another thing to add here is that the text does not really support this theory, as it says 'it was made to appear so' or '[another] was made to resemble him'. This theory would more so imply that the Romans simply made a mistake, not Allah deceiving the people at the time.<br><br>And another thing to add here is that this does not really explain the rise of christianity. Suppose Jesus never claimed to be God, and another man was crucified in Jesus' place and Jesus Himself was taken up to Allah, that means this man would have simply died on the cross. Why did the christian movement not stop? Unless they physically saw Jesus being taken up to Allah, but that also doesn't explain the fact they worshipped him as God. Why did the church start in the first place? What did Jesus communicate to them that they started worshipping Him as the Son of God? Why do they say Jesus resurrected from the dead if Jesus was taken up to Allah when he was condemned to be crucified and the man resembling Jesus simply died on the cross? Islam has no answers."

Firstly, we can correctly establish that the preservation of the Quran is horrible or simply not good (read 'The Quran's Preservation'), the full compilation of the Quran was a complete disaster, verses were forgotten, abrogated and purposely not chosen, and many variant readings exist today.<br><br> Secondly, the Quran affirms the inspiration, preservation and authority of the Bible (read 'Arguments against Islam' --> 'The Islamic Dilemma'). With this being said, rejecting Christianity because of a supposed corruption or bad preservation is applying a huge double standard. You cannot reject Christianity for a supposed corrupted scripture when your own book is heavily corrupted and also confirms the Bible we have today as true and preserved. So, the argument that the bible is corrupted already falls flat, but let us nonetheless investigate the preservation of the Bible. is the Bible actually corrupted?"

All of those persons share the same divine essence and are therefore the same one true God. The first person of the trinity (trinity = tri (three) + unity) is the Father. The Father is the source of the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son (also called the word of God) is eternally begotten by the Father. ('So a human being is God?' No, not exactly. The word of God has always existed with the father, and then it took on flesh, that is, became a human, Jesus Christ.) The Spirit eternally proceeds from the father through the son. So, the Father is the source, the unbegotten person of the Trinity. The Son comes eternally from him, and the Spirit comes eternally from both. If you find this idea complicated, you shouldn't forget that God is the greatest being to ever exist, unlike anything in creation and beyond our understanding. Naturally we would expect God to exist in a special way.<br><br>If you're a muslim, you can phrase it like this: God, his eternal word, and his Spirit. Both of these words are found in the Quran.<br><br>Here are some analogies (no analogy 100% describes the Trinity, please be careful when making / listening to analogies about the Trinity):<br><br>1. The sun is the Father. The light that comes forth from the sun is the Son. The warmth coming from the sun through the light is the Holy spirit.<br><br>2. The Father is the one who speaks, from him comes his word, which is the Son. The breath is the Holy Spirit, which comes from the speaker through the word he is speaking."

Prayer: the Quran does tell muslims to pray, but not how to. the number of daily prayers and how many rakahs (units), the timing of these prayers, the sequence of movements (standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting) are not mentioned in the Quran. The Quran also says 'recite' but not what to recite, the hadiths make it clear. the Quran does also not tell you: to pray towards the Kaaba, how to peform ablution before prayer (order of washing, how many times to wash each part, and exceptions), and how to dress during prayer.<br><br>2. Zakat: the Quran tells muslims to give charity, but not how much, on what assets, and to whom.<br><br>3. Hajj rituals: the Quran tells muslims to go to Mecca, but not the details: what clothing they need put on, which actions to avoid, walking around the kaaba 7 times counterclockwise, walking or jogging seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwah near the Kaaba, and all other details about the pilgrimage.<br><br>4. More on ablution (washing)<br><br>5. Fasting<br><br>6. Law, Halal & Haram<br><br>7. Social & Family life: marriage, etc.<br><br>The reality is, most of islamic practice comes from the hadiths. If you reject the hadiths, you're basically no muslim anymore. The Quran also condemns this viewpoint. Another thing to add is that there are numerous verses in the Quran that you simply cannot fully understand without a hadith explaining it.
